# HPC-AI 2024 Benchmark Suite 
Welcome to the HPC-AI 2024 Benchmark Suite repository. This repository showcases the results and methodologies of TULP_TEAM as we participate in the 7th APAC HPC-AI Competition.

High-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) are foundational to advancing modern scientific research. These tools address the increasing complexity of research questions and growing demands for computation power, driving ongoing innovation in scientific computing. The APAC HPC-AI Competition invites university and technical institute teams from the APAC region to showcase their expertise in HPC and AI, fostering critical skills, building professional relationships, and developing lifelong camaraderie.
